# Todo List

## Short Description

## Learning Outcomes

## Features

1. Added ESLint and Airbnb base to project to ensure a consistent set of styling rules are applied to code base.

2. Added Prettier to project so that the same version of Prettier is used by anyone working on the code base as the styling rules may evolve over time. Extended Prettier in .eslintrc.json so that ESLint and Prettier play nicely together.

## Installation Guide
